# Overview 
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis using three different neural network architectures: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Basic Neural Network (NN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The sentiment analysis is based on the GloVe dataset, which provides pre-trained word vectors.

# Introduction
Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, typically classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral. This project leverages three different neural network architectures to perform sentiment analysis on the GloVe dataset.

# Dataset
The sentiment analysis is performed on the GloVe dataset, which contains pre-trained word vectors. The dataset is automatically downloaded and processed during the first run.
# Models:
# CNN
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model utilizes convolutional layers to extract features from the input text, followed by dense layers for classification.
# Basic NN
The Basic Neural Network (NN) model is a simple feedforward neural network with dense layers for sentiment analysis.
# LSTM
The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model employs LSTM layers to capture long-term dependencies in the input text.
# Dependencies
    Python 3.x
    TensorFlow
    Keras
    NumPy
    Pandas
